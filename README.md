# Predicting Automobile Fuel Efficiency: A Bayesian Inference Approach

## Project Aims

Our project aims to take a Bayesian Inference approach to creating a model to predict the MPG of a car given some set parameters about said car. We will set a prior distribution for the parameters, as well as a likelihood for the model as a whole. We will then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the values for the weights of each of these parameters. More specifically, we will use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm defined in [1]. We will use the "Auto MPG Data Set" dataset from [2] to build our deterministic model for predicting MPG.
